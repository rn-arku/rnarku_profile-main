## Research Interests

I am interested in the processes of "urban transformation" across both the global north and south.

Urban transformation refers to the change and development that occurs in urban areas, including physical, social, and economic changes. It can also involve significant investment in the built-environment through the renovation or redevelopment of existing buildings and infrastructure and the creation of new buildings and public spaces. This has the potential to induce changes in the demographic and socioeconomic makeup of the population, as well as increase land values.

Significantly driven by public actions (e.g., investment in transit infrastructure), my work adopts an evidence-based equity lens to examine potential consequences arising from urban transformation processes. Research areas to date include:

-   Urban land/real estate economics (estimating land value uplift)
-   Data science and spatio-econometric techniques
-   Transport geography
-   Transit infrastructure investment and transit-oriented developments
-   Gentrification and residential displacement
-   Urban planning and policy
-   Smart cities
-   Public participation

## Ongoing Projects

As part of the [Mobilizing Justice Partnership](https://mobilizingjustice.ca/), I am focusing on transit-induced gentrification and displacement in Canada by tracing the impacts of transit infrastructure investment on the property market and on intra-urban migration.

This work is guided by the above conceptual framework offered by [Nilsson and Delmelle, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.102364). The framework shows the link between transit investment and neighborhood changes.
