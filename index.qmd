I am pursuing doctoral studies at the [Department of Geography and Planning](https://www.geography.utoronto.ca/) (affiliated with the [Spatial Analysis of Urban Systems Lab](http://sausy.ca/)), University of Toronto, Canada. I love reading, watching sports and listening to music (Note: The bass guitar is the greatest of all musical instruments). My fave kind of movies: COMEDY! And no, don't tell me your dog doesn't bite - I still won't pet it.
