    "text": "I am interested in the processes of “urban transformation” across both the global north and south.\nUrban transformation refers to the change and development that occurs in urban areas, including physical, social, and economic changes. It can also involve significant investment in the built-environment through the renovation or redevelopment of existing buildings and infrastructure and the creation of new buildings and public spaces. This has the potential to induce changes in the demographic and socioeconomic makeup of the population, as well as increase land values.\nSignificantly driven by public actions (e.g., investment in transit infrastructure), my work adopts an evidence-based equity lens to examine potential consequences arising from urban transformation processes. Research areas to date include:\n\nUrban land/real estate economics (estimating land value uplift)\nData science and spatio-econometric techniques\nTransport geography\nTransit infrastructure investment and transit-oriented developments\nGentrification and residential displacement\nUrban planning and policy\nSmart cities\nPublic participation"

The framework shows the link between transit investment and neighborhood changes."
